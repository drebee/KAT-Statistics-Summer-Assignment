## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

# 1. Install the libraries

R is a programming language. It's useful for general-purpose tasks.

Other people on the internet have added fancy special-purpose features.

RStudio will go download those special-purpose features from the internet for you.

**Click on the yellow banner at the top of the page where it says "Install".**

You only have to do this once.

# 2. Load the libraries

The gray box below is a code box. It has some code you need to run so R knows you want to use the libraries you installed.

**Click on the greed triangle in the upper right corner of the code box.**

You have to do this again every time you open up RStudio!

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
```

# 3. Look at the data

Copy-paste this link into a web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lYL1TvyNuLsGGCRR016CLqnd98x43ljM7bpJN7IEWkc.

This is data from 2 years ago. We will look at the Date/Block Dataset tab, which (among other things) shows what scores students got on MCQ (multiple choice question) quizzes and what scores students got on FRQ (free response question) quizzes.

# 4. Load the data into RStudio

The code box below reads the spreadsheet from Google Drive.

**Click on the greed triangle in the upper right corner of the code box.**

Then, a prompt will show up at the bottom of the screen. It will ask you how you want to log in. Tell it to "Send me to the browser for a new auth process". Then log in online using your Kehillah Google account. Make sure to check boxes for all the permissions, if it asks.

```{r}
url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lYL1TvyNuLsGGCRR016CLqnd98x43ljM7bpJN7IEWkc"
df = read_sheet(url, sheet = "Date/Block Dataset") |> select(quiz_type, percent) |> drop_na()
```

# 5. Extract the FRQ and MCQ scores

The code below will extract the FRQ scores and MCQ scores into variables that we can use later.

**Click on the greed triangle in the upper right corner of the code box.**

```{r}
frq_scores = df |> filter(quiz_type == "FRQ") |> pull(percent)
mcq_scores = df |> filter(quiz_type == "MCQ") |> pull(percent)
```

# 6. Calculate the average FRQ score

Run the code box below. It will tell you that the average FRQ score was about 64%.

```{r}
mean(frq_scores)
```

# 7. Calculate the average MCQ score.

Edit the code block box below and then run it. It will tell you that the average MCQ score was about 73%.

```{r}

```

# 8. Graph the FRQ scores

Run the code below. It will make a histogram plot of the FRQ scores.

```{r}
hist(frq_scores)
```

# 9. Graph the MCQ scores

Run the code below. It will make a histogram plot of the MCQ scores.

```{r}

```

# 10. Send me your code

1. Save this file.

2. In the top menu bar, go to Tools > Version Control > Commit...

3. In the box labeled "Commit message", type "Analyze MCQ data"

4. Click the "Commit" button

5.
